# Arduino-WellControl

This program is created to tests wells and ensure that they have the desired flowrate and the consistency to be a part of a bigger machine.

The program controls the automation process which eliminates human error and speeds up the process. With an interactive menu on a 4x20 digit LCD display, the technicians remain in control of the methods they want to use to test the well, but with more consistency.

The automation aspect of the project increased the efficiency of the tests by around 90%. Each thermal equipment usually needs 20~25 minutes to be tested, but that has been cut down by the program to around 2 minutes. At its busiest time, the lab requires testing of 100 equipments, which takes a little over 33 hours of operation non-stop. The program cuts that time down to less than 4 hours.
